The python code trains a CNN-model with images as a dataset, which is further assessed by the accuracy obtained on the test set.The aim is to get high train and test set accuracy.

First, create two folders'train' and 'test' in the working directory

Again create two subfolders in each of the 'train' and 'test' foldrs containg the category of images into which you want to classify the image

Run the'CNN_MODEL.PY' to check the accuracy obtained on train and test data sets

You can set the no. of epochs and dimension of the feature extractor
